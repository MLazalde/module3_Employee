# Employee Payroll Tracker

## Description:

This application should ask for a input from an administrator to create a table of employee's first and last name, as well as their salary. The console should be able to average out their salaries and provide a fun way to recognize a random employee.

The application makes use of an HTML, CSS, and JS file. 

## Challenges to overcome in the Future

I am learning the syntax of various functions and methods, so I wrote ample notes for myself to be able to better learn them in the future.

## How to use:


1. Click on the "Add Employee" button
2. Follow the onscreen prompts to add the employee's First Name, Last Name, and Salary.
3. Continue until you have added all of your employees and their information.
4. When prompted to add "Another Employee" hit cancel to exit.
5. This will provide you with a form which has been sorted alphabetically by last name, displaying all of your entered information.
6. Press F12 to open the console.
7. This will show you the average Salary and random prize winner.
